    "# Lab 6 - Databases and Large Data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in the course we have looked at various techniques for dealing with data, manipulating text and files and even how to scrape websites for data. But sometimes we want data from a pre-existing dataset such as those provided by [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start) or other data collecting agencies. The way we access these datasets is by downloading them from their respective websites or we can sometimes use an API, or application program interface, to import the data directly into our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other ways of getting data is from a database. Databases are ways to store lots of data and they come with a query language. A query language allows users to pull data from the database using various keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will look at how to use APIs and how to turn them into a database so that we can practise using a query language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set that we will be working with today is the [US 2013 language survey](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/language-stats.html). We will learn how to call the API and get the language statistics for a specific language. Once we have this data we will turn it into a mySQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardest part about obtaining data from an API call is structuring the API call correctly. For the API that we will work with the base link that we will use is `https://api.census.gov/data/2013/language?` This is known as the API call and we will be adding our arguments after the question mark. In order to get data we need to specify what we want, in our case we want to get the number of speakers, the language and the state name. To get this we add `get=EST,LANLABEL,NAME`. To find out what each label does we could reference the [API documentation](https://api.census.gov/data/2013/language/variables.html). Finally we need to specify for which state we want the data and what language we want. We add `&for=state:*` where the * means we want all states and we add `&LAN=625` to get the Spanish language data. You can reference the [language codes document](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/about/language-use/primary_language_list.pdf) to find the correct code for each language. \n",

You can think of JSON files as normal text files that are structured in a specific way that is easy to work with. To read up on JSON files you can follow the tutorial [here](https://beginnersbook.com/2015/04/json-tutorial/). While it is written from the perspective of a Javascript developer, it is still a good introduction, so don't worry about some of the particular code snippets you may not fully understand.\n",

    "We could stop here and start analyzing our data since it is in a very workable fromat. For this lab, however, the focus isn't on analyzing data but it is about how to manage and store big ammounts of data. For this we will start to learn how to use a database.

In this lab we will use SQLite to introduce ourselves to database setup and handling.\n",

Now that you know what SQL is we can get into creating a database and creating our first table to store the language statistics we pulled from the API. \n",

Inside of the parentheses are the table headers, so we created columns for item from our API data. Notice the \"PRIMARY KEY\" label after the stateCode. This label lets the table know that this item in the list must be unique for each data point.
